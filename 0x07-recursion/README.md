# Recursion

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* what recursion is and how to use it

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line (puts)
1. a function that prints a string in reverse
2. a function that returns the length of a string
3. a function that returns the factorial of a given number
4. a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y (pow)
5. a function that returns the natural square root of a number
6. a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0
7. a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
8. a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0

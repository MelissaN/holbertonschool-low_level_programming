## Synopsis

This project introduces functions and nested loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while the holberton.h file contains all the function prototypes.

### Description of what each file does
0. prints "Holberton"
1. prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3. checks for lowercase character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
4. checks for alphabetic character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
5. prints the sign of a number
6. computes the absolute value of an integer
7. prints the last digit of a number
8. prints every minute starting from 00:00 to 23:59
9. prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
10. adds two integers and returns the result
11. prints all natural numbers from n to 98
100. prints the n times table, starting with 0
101. computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
102. prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
103. considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
104. finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
